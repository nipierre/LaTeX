\section{Inclusive and Semi-Inclusive Radiative Correction factors}\label{sec:RCF}

The calculation of the inclusive radiative correction factors can be done by computing
$\sigma_{Born}$ and $\sigma_{Born+o(\alpha)}$. A correct way to obtain these factors is the following :

\[\eta(x,y)=\frac{\sigma_{Born}(x,y)}{\sigma_{Born+o(\alpha)}(x,y)}
=\frac{\frac{\sigma_{Born,tot}*N_{Born}(x,y)}{N_{Born,tot}}}{\frac{\sigma_{Born+o(\alpha),tot}*N_{Born+o(\alpha)}(x,y)}{N_{Born+o(\alpha),tot}}}\]

The results that are presented below are obtained with the TERAD $F_{2}$ and R parametrizations, which
describes accurately the behaviour of $F_{2}$ at low $Q^{2}$\cite{BPnote} :

\begin{itemize}
\item $F^{p}_{2}(x,Q2)$ for $Q^2 > 0.2$ GeV$^2$ and $0.000035 < x < 0.85$, as obtained from a fit to the
world proton (and deuteron) data made by the SMC\cite{SMC}.
\item For $Q^2 < 0.2$ GeV$^2$, a phenomenological model of Badelek and Kwiecinski\cite{BK}, valid at $10^{-5} < x < 0.1$
and $0 < Q^2 < 1000$ GeV$^2$.
\item $R(x, Q^2)$ as parameterised by SLAC (newer version, called R1998\cite{R1998}), valid for $Q^2 > 0.5$ GeV$^2$, extended
to lower values of Q2, including the $R \simeq Q^2$ behaviour at $Q^2 = 0$.
\end{itemize}

The $o(\alpha)$ are included except for quark line radiation. The reason why these corrections are not
included is that these corrections are negligible except at large $x \geq 0.5$ and $Q^{2} \geq 10^3$ GeV$^2$,
where the corrections reach the magnitude of barely one percent (see Fig. \ref{fig:quarkline}). Also, even though this is not the
case in TERAD $F_{2}$, these corrections are often not subtracted inside the parametrization, thus
they are already taken into account in the parametrization\cite{HubertF2Rad}.

lepton-proton scattering at $x=0.001$, $x=0.1$ and $x=0.505$.}\label{fig:quarkline}
\end{figure}

The kinematic range for the presented results is $x \in [0.004,0.9]$ and $y \in [0.1,0.9]$.

Overall, the corrections on the considered kinematic space are within 10\% except for high $y$ corrections
that go up to 40\%.

\subsection{Radiative correction factors : Effect on Multiplicities}\label{sec:RCFMult}

The calculation of the radiative correction factors to the multiplcities can be done by computing
$M^{h^{\pm}}_{Born}$, multiplicities obtained without radiative corrections, and $M^{h^{\pm}}_{Born+o(\alpha)}$,
multiplicities obtained with radiative corrections. The factors can be defined as :

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \eta^{h^{\pm}}(x,y,z)=\frac{M^{h^{\pm}}_{Born}(x,y,z)}{M^{h^{\pm}}_{Born+o(\alpha)}(x,y,z)} \\
     = \frac{N^{h^{\pm}}_{Born}(x,y,z)/N^{DIS}_{Born}(x,y)}{N^{h^{\pm}}_{Born+o(\alpha)}(x,y,z)/N^{DIS}_{Born+o(\alpha)}(x,y)}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

where $N^h$ is the number of hadrons and $N^{DIS}$ the number of DIS events.


In the following plot, the cuts from the SIDIS analysis for the selection of DIS events and
hadrons are used (see Chapter. \ref{ch:raw} for further details). The kinematical cuts that are used are explicitated in the following :

\begin{itemize}
\item $0.004 \leq x_{Bj} \leq 0.4, x_{Bj} \in \{.004,.01,.02,.03,.04,.06,.1,.14,.18,.4\}$
\item $0.1 \leq y \leq 0.7, y \in \{.1,.15,.2,.3,.5,.\}$
\item $12 \leq p_h \leq 40$ GeV
\end{itemize}

Fig. \ref{fig:hadz_ratio} exhibits the semi-inclusive radiative correction factor $\eta^{h^{\pm}}(x,y,z)$. This factor goes from 0\% correction
at low $z$ and low $y$ to 10\% correction at high $z$ and high $y$. This dependance on $y$ and $z$ is expected (eg. if a hadron has a high
$z$ in a non-radiative event, consider the same event but with the radiation of a real photon, $\nu_{lep}$ will remain the same but the hadron will have
in reality less energy available from the virtual photon, thus having $z_{had} \leq z_{lep}$, leading to less events in the high $z$ region for the multiplicities
obtained with radiative corrections).

\section{Comparison between DJANGOH and TERAD}

In the next figures, DJANGOH results are compared with TERAD\cite{TERAD}. The two programs are using the same set of $F^{p}_{2}$ and $R$. This are the only inputs (apart from the process input ie. $\mu p$ scattering at 160 GeV muon energy) that need to be identical so that the comparison is relevant. One thing to be noted is that TERAD is using more complete sets of correction. They should have an impact on the cross-section of TERAD, but are negligible.

The first check for consistency is to compare the $\sigma_{Born}$ of both programs. Using the same input information on $F^{p}_{2}(x,Q2)$ and $R(x, Q^2)$ does not guarantee that $\sigma_{Born}$ for both program, called $\sigma^{D}_{Born}$ and $\sigma^{T}_{Born}$, is the same : the reason is that for example in TERAD, $\sigma^{T}_{Born}$ is computed without constants like $\pi$, $M_{proton}$, $\alpha$, etc. and its functional form is unknown, unlike in DJANGOH. This means that the ratio $r=\frac{\sigma^{D}_{Born}}{\sigma^{T}_{Born}}$ may differ from 1 but must be constant as a function of $x$ and $y$. Fig. \ref{fig:BRy} shows that this is the case.

\begin{figure}[htb]

\caption{Ratio of the Born cross-sections calculated with DJANGOH and TERAD, for the same input, as a function of $y$
at different values of $x$ (staggered points at fixed $y$)}\label{fig:BRy}
\end{figure}

The radiative correction factors $\eta(x,y)$ for DJANGOH and TERAD are compared in Fig. \ref{fig:RCy}. The absolute difference is then plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:ERy}, showing that the two programs differ at most 3\% in the region of lowest $x$ and highest $y$. This results is extremely good, knowing that DJANGOH and TERAD are not using the same renormalization scheme.

\section{Summary}

The DJANGOH event generator with radiative events is a way to access radiative correction factor in a three dimensional ($x$,$y$,$z$) binning, like in the multiplicity analysis. This kind of correction are unprecedented for this analysis inside the COMPASS collaboration. The size of the correction, going from 0 to 20\% is within the expectations. Moreover, this correction can directly be applied on the multiplicities. When compared with TERAD computation on the inclusive corrections, the results of DJANGOH are shown to be compatible within 3\%, a really good result knowing that DJANGOH and TERAD are not using the same renormalization scheme.
